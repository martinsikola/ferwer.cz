Ferwer full story

Dive into truly sustainable fashion with us that will quickly earn a place in your wardrobe.

In one place, we offer you quality, ethical fashion from around the world that has minimal impact on the environment and carries a story that will captivate you.
The beginning of our journey started back in 2014 when we first introduced the colourful brand Inkkas in the Czech Republic.

Extraordinary handmade shoes made with fabrics from local producers in Peru, produced according to Fair Trade principles and rules in Mexico.

We were thrilled that you were as excited about these colorful and original sneakers with a story as we were, and our idea of offering fair and ethical fashion from around the world in one place became increasingly true.

So it wasn't long before in 2016 we managed to arrange a collaboration with another beautiful and responsible brand, making their shoes with love and from recycled materials.

Brazilian brand Perky brought even more color and lightness to our portfolio.

Another milestone that solidified what we've been going for since the beginning was watching the documentaryThe True Cost (recommended for anyone who hasn't seen it), which exposes the harsh conditions of the garment industry and the so-called "true cost" of the garment industry. Fast Fashion.

In 2017, we reached out to Ecoalf, a young Spanish brand making vegan shoes from plastic fished from the ocean floor or eco-friendly clothing made from organic cotton or recycled materials such as fishing nets or used tires.

Because we care about the background of our clothing, in 2020 we have expanded our range to include another unique brand SKFK, making their clothing from recycled or organic cotton in Spain.

In 2022, we expanded our range to include a range of eco-drugs that are chemical-free and not tested on animals. In addition, we have translated our website into 15 languages and we sell to all of Europe.

For every order we plant a tree!
In partnership with the Trees.org Foundation, we will send a prize for every pair of shoes or clothing sold, equivalent to the amount of one tree planted according to the foundation's current project. Learn more at trees.org.

For the year 2022, Ferwer has contributed
* planted over 7,350 trees
* this will help remove over 370 tons of CO2

according to the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), 370 tons of CO2 is equivalent to
- 1,450,000 miles driven by the average vehicle or
- 156,400 gallons of gasoline or
- 179,500 pounds of coal burned or
- 43,600,000 iPhones recharged

When ordering new goods, we always choose the shipping that has the smallest carbon footprint and package each order in recycled paper.
